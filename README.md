Shark O'Clock Project:
Our theme for the project is surfing, and we started with the goal of answering the question: "Is there a clear way to detect risk patterns within the environments for surfers?"
We split the project into columns to clean individually (trying to group columns that are correlated): the most crucial step was to create a new column to filter the dataset "Surfing" and all related activities.

In the code provided, we described the goal and thought-process behind each block of code, and to sum it up, we split the data cleaning as follows:
1 - Location, Hemispheres, Seasons + Fatal
2 - Year, Month, Activity
3 - Hour and Time of Day (morning, afternoon, evening)

The final objective for our project was:
- creating an application or API that cross-references historical shark attack data on surfers with data on location, month of the year, and time of day.
- what it should do: provides a risk forecast based on historical data for surfers and surf schools.
- business Model: monthly subscription for individual practitioners, partnerships with insurance companies (differentiated sports insurance), or API sales to existing surf/weather apps.

Further upgrades: Integrating real-time data on tide levels, water temperature, wind conditions, fish school presence (baitfish), and maritime traffic to provide a real-time
